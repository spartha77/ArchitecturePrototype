# ArchitecturePrototype
Commands and Observers prototype

This repository contains the basic framework for commands and observers needed for a design problem that needs to execute a set of commands, cross-platform, which also needs a continuous output streaming from a running command.

This source is not complete and will not compile. This version is only to upload the source files for reference. 

For the detailed explanations on the design and other components, please refer to README_SkillsFrameworkMotivationAndDesign.docx

Good reading!
